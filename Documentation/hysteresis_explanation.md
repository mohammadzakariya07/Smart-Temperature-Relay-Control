# Hysteresis Explanation

Hysteresis is used to prevent relay chatter caused by small temperature fluctuations around a threshold.

Each relay has:
- Lower threshold → Relay ON
- Upper threshold → Relay OFF

Once a relay changes state, it will not switch again until the opposite threshold is crossed.

This method:
- Increases relay lifespan
- Improves system stability
- Prevents unnecessary switching
- Enhances safety in thermal applications
